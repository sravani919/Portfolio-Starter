          <p>I am proud to share that Sravani is one of my favourite student. I have known her since 2017, and during her undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of teaching her two or more subjects. She consistently demonstrated a keen interest in learning, always engaging with me to clarify doubts and seek additional information. Her proactive approach to learning and her ability to grasp concepts thoroughly set her apart.
            Sravani's dedication and hardworking nature were evident in her academic achievements. She consistently scored well in her undergraduate examinations, ultimately earning a rank in her final year from VTU. Currently, she is pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Clemson University in the USA, while simultaneously working as a data analyst intern at CEDC.
            I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Sravani on her achievements thus far, and I wish her all the best for the future. May she continue to expand her knowledge and skills, particularly in areas such as AI, ML, Deep Learning, and Cybersecurity. With her determination and passion for learning, I have no doubt that Sravani will make significant contributions to society.</p>
