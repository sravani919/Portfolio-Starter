        <h2>Real_time_Knowledge_Acquisition</h2>
        <p>This project’s primary goal is to demonstrate how the College Information
            Management System’s standards should be met. It is meant
            to assist organizations in maintaining and managing personal information data. It is a complete project created from
            the ground up with the primary goal of meeting the demands
            of colleges as they instruct their pupils. Using this integrated
            information management system, daily operations in the
            collegiate environment, including student communication
            channels and attendance management, and educators. This
            minimizes data inaccuracy and guarantees that all of the
            information is current.<br>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>

        <br>
           <p> This project details the numerous procedures and methods
            used while putting up specifications, developing, implementing, and testing for the project on the college management
            system in acquiring knowledge. The problems regarding the
            current system in the college environment were analyzed
            and noted. This project aims to solve some of those problems
            in the current system, adding more value. The requirements
            were gathered from all the stakeholders. Using that information, we developed requirement models and software designs.
            The task was carried out as a website using Django (python).
            We implemented the college using the materials and tools we
            obtained along the route. A system employing some features
            to address the system’s current issues, such as an editing
            provision before locking it at the conclusion, the software
            was also tested utilizing numerous Test procedures, and the
            outcomes were successful.</p> <br>
        
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The goal of the College ERP system, which means Real-time
            knowledge acquisition is to give administrators of any organization the capacity to update and discover a student’s
            personal information while allowing the student to maintain
            privacy. Additionally, it will make it easier to maintain all
            of the student details, including their name, ID, postal code,
            contact info, date of birth, etc. Consequently, a student’s
            complete information will be accessible quickly. Overall, the
            administrator and the student will find it easier to manage
            student information in any institution.</p><br>
       
        
        <h3>Related Works</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The commercial world of the twenty-first century is faced
            with new challenges. Developments in computing and communication technology. It points to a future reality where
            nearly all human behaviour might be intimately affected,
            encouraged, observed, and occasionally managed by pervasive telecommunications and computer technologies. This
            implies a critical and immediate Methodologies (solutions,
            techniques) for engineering and science must be developed.
            frameworks) for creating, constructing, and analyzing intricate systems that focus on basic human activities facilitated
            by technology and communication technology.
            
            <br>
            The most efficient software program for assisting with
            the overall independence of restrictions imposed by technology, software, and people resources.. Nevertheless,
            the adoption of ERP with successful. Inappropriate use of
            design is one of the prominent causes of failure. And the ERP
            adoption process.
            <br>
            Additionally, ERP is defined.as a word used in the business
           for a large number of activities supported by multiple modules of application software that aids businesses in managing
           their most critical operations procedures, such as product
            planning, purchasing, inventory control, customer service
            interactions, dealing with suppliers, and tracking shipments
            
        <h3> User Methodology</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <h4>User Survey</h4>
        <br>
        <p>There are various approaches to user
            research. One is a face-to-face survey, and the other is an online survey. To gather information for our project survey, we
            opted to speak with a few stakeholders, including teachers,
            administrators, students, and parents. We have already identified three essential stakeholders. Using SurveyMonkey, we
            gathered data and viewpoints on target consumers’ perceptions of the current ERP system. The questions centered on
            their general impressions of their encounters. They discussed
            their roles within the ERP system, any issues they were having, their likes and dislikes, problems with the program, and
            how it was being used. The survey results indicate several
            usability issues we addressed through system improvements
            and design adjustments.<br>
        <h4>Experimental Design </h4>
        <br>
        <p>This project made use of
            a variety of design theories and procedures. The software
            is broken up into modules that are each functionally independent and use information masking, following the separation of concerns and notions. As a result, modifying a
            module without impacting other system components was
            possible. Additionally, a more effective development method
            was produced by segmenting the system into various unique
            elements that can be created and evaluated separately. Three
            modules make up the software: administrators, teachers, and
            students</p><br>
        <h4> Architectural Design </h4>
        <br>
        <p>An architectural design is
            necessary for the ERP software to represent the software’s
            architecture. It displays a data-centric architecture. The system comprises various parts that work together to form it,
            and connectors will promote component cooperation, coordination, and communication.</p><br>
        <h4>  Implementation </h4>
    
        <br>
        <p>We used the Windows operating
            system because of its excellent support and usability. All the
            student and faculty data were saved in a database that we
            created using MySQL, and this database is updated, added to,
            deleted from, or otherwise changed. We took advantage of
            the SQLite database that is included with Django by default.
            Students can request access to the repository’s data, and the
            request is fulfilled. Faculty members update the repository’s
            data. Clients may be added or removed by administrators. We
            created a web interface to enable user interaction with the
            data via the web server. Bootstrap is used to create the user interface. We used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end
            development, and for the back-end implementation, Python
            and Django. We integrated the Bootstrap framework to give
            our application a modern, responsive design. We wrote our
            application code in Python and used the Django web framework to organize and structure our code. Since Django is
            an easy-to-use Python framework and is appropriate for
            beginners, we used it for the website’s back end.</p><br>
        <h3>Results and Outcomes</h3>
        <br>
        <p>These are the outcomes
            from our project.Everyone has same login page but access
            or permission depends upon the type of user using the website.The student is shown a home page containing their
            primary sections, attendance, and marks after successfully
            logging in and schedule. The student can monitor their attendance status in the attendance area, which contains the
            total classes, the classes that were present, and the attendance percentage for each of their courses.Each teacher in
            the college is assigned a unique username and password by
            the administrator. The instructor may change the password
            later. The administrator is responsible for adding and managing all departments, students, teachers, and other users.
            The username is their teacher ID,Classes and courses. All
            of this information is kept in a database in various tables.
            The administrator is also accountable for updating the list of
            instructors assigned to each course’s classes and the timings.
            This information is stored in the Assign table. The admin
            also has access to the marks and Each student’s attendance
            affects them in some way.

        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <br>
        <p>To verify the functioning of our system and create user test
            cases, we employed two testing methodologies: white box
            testing and black box testing. Python is used to implement
            this project, along with the Django framework. We tested the models and views in the code. We created a Python file named
            test.py, where we wrote unit tests for the models and theories.
            We found this highly efficient because it automates testing,
            allowing us to stop manually testing each page after any
            modifications. We ran "black box" testing on the teacher’s
            page to ensure that each page functioned as intended. We
            considered several test cases and recorded the outcomes</p>
        <br>
        <h4>White-box Testing</h4>
        <br>
        <p> Contrary to black box testing, white box testing involves access to internal data structures and algorithms (as well as the
            code that implements them). Whitebox testing techniques
            can help also. Determine whether a test suite produced using
            black box testing methodologies is complete. It makes the
            team check the integrated parts of the system, which are
            rarely tested, and helps us to get essential functions. Models
            make up the code for this project, which is built in Python
            using the Django framework and testable points of view.
            Neither table model is stored in SQL, and the link between
            employing foreign keys is. A view function, or "view" for
            short, is a Python function. That receives a web request and
            responds with a web response. This response may contain
            a Webpage or is direct, a 404 error, an XML document, an
            image, etc. Moreover, Python offers a package named test.py
            where we can create unit tests for the models and views. This
            is particularly helpful because it automates testing, eliminating the need for human page testing later.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Black-box Testing</h4>
        <br>
        <p> Blackbox testing ignores the internal implementation of the
            software and treats it as a "black box." Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and all-pairs testing are examples of black box testing methodologies. Fuzz tests, modelbased tests, traceability matrix tests, exploratory tests, and
            specification-based tests.We performed black box testing on
            the teacher page to ensure every page worked as desired. We
            took into consideration various test cases and noted down
            the results. Below we have recorded different test cases and
            their respective results.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Testcase 1</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Obtain the attendance page for a teacher who has one assigned class. The website showed the allocated class, options
            for entering attendance, and a student roster</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Testcase 2</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Request the teacher’s attendance page if they have no assigned classes. The message "Teacher has no classes assigned" was loaded on the website</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Testcase 3</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Requesting to enter attendance for a class that is allocated
            to one test student The student’s information is displayed
            on the website, along with a checkbox for present or absent.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Testcase 4</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Make a request to change the attendance for a class that
            has one test student. The student is recorded with his or
            her information and is first marked as having missed the
            prior test. When marking present, the student can view their
            attendance.</p><br>
        <h4>Testcase 5</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Requesting to enter the marks for a single-student allocated
            class Initially,a list of tests is displays such as internals1, SEE
            etc. On selecting one of internals1,the teachers an enter the
            marks for the student out of 20 . On submitting, the status
            for that test turns Green indicates that it was entered successfully.</p><br>
        <h4>Testcase 6</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Request to alter the marks for a single-student-assigned class
            For each class, there is a list of tests such as internal1, SEE
            etc. As the marks for internals1 was previously completed
            the exam, it is marked green, and there is an opportunity
            to alter it. The already-stored markings can be changed and
            saved while still being clearly visible.</p><br>
        <h4>Testcase 7</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Requesting access to student data for an allocated class without any students The requested page appears empty and
            with the message "This class has no students assigned.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Testcase 8</h4>
        <p>Requesting access to student data for a single-student-assigned
            class The website contains a table with entries for the student’s name, USN, and attendance percentage, marks in each
            test, including three interns, two events, and one 1SEE.If the
            attendance status is below 75 percent, as indicated.</p>

        <br>
        
        <h3>Test Results</h3>
        <br>
        <p>After using various testing techniques, including black box
            and white box testing, we conclude that the software testing
            is finished. White box testing is carried out to apply unit
            tests to each project component utilizing a built-in Django
            capability. Instead of performing extensive manual testing
            after every update, we were able to run the tests on the
            program automatically after a few modifications to the initial
            code, which allowed us to quickly identify and fix any faults
            or errors in the system. The entire design and all its parts are
            tested in black box testing. Numerous test situations were
            taken into consideration, and considerable testing was done.
            Positive test results were obtained, and any discrepancies
            were eliminated during the testing phase</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The ERP system we installed can be enhanced to alter the
            institution’s operations, automating and digitalizing all academic and administrative procedures. We are now striving to
            integrate our technology into the HCC environment further.
            Our already-implemented system can be further customized
            and designed to autonomously supervise the ERP training
            systems to monitor crucial student data, such as marking attendance, retrieving timetables, and all other tasks, enabling
            teachers to make informed judgments. The system can be
            integrated with intelligent dashboards to generate predictive
            analytics for all departments, which will enable HCC to use
            the collected data for strategic decision-making and longterm planning. The project’s future goals include making the
            ERP system extremely secure and reliable to allow process
            personalization and modification for each individual. The
            system can be improved to include interactive elements that
            enable simple interaction between the students and teachers,
            helping to narrow the communication gap between them effectively. However, future research will need to examine
            the concepts described thoroughly</p>
        <br>
       

        
        <h3>Conclusion </h3>
        <br>
        <p>Accessing information from less is a complex operation
            with the existing System, and there is no simple method
            or straightforward approach to maintaining student information and statistics. Lack of automation is also seen in the
            current System .Our System aims to reduce the workload
            and to save the significant time. The System’s name, CollegeERPSystem, refers to how it handles problems relating
            to a particular university. It is beneficial to students and faculties by facilitating easy access to learning. The specifics.
            The college ERP gives customers the correct information
            based on their performance and job. This project is designed
            with the day-to-day issues a college system faces in mind
            and demonstrates how faculty and user interact. The critical
            issue with maintaining and managing the administrator’s
            duties is that it comes. Before this, it took a lot of work to
            support the timetable and keep track of the daily schedule.
            But by developing this web-based application, the administrator can enjoy the task, doing it efficiently and conserving
            crucial time. Time consumption is decreased, and manual
            calculations are omitted; the reports can be obtained regularly and whenever on demand by the user. The effective
            utilization of the work by properly sharing it and providing
            accurate results. The storage facility will ease the job of the
            operator. Thus the System developed will be helpful to the
            administration by making their job easier </p><br>
