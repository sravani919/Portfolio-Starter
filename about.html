            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
                I am an enthusiastic AI and Data Scientist with a passion for using machine learning, data analysis, data engineering, and natural language processing (NLP) to solve real-world challenges. My journey into data science began during my internship at Aptech in 2019, where I implemented machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression on AWS EC2 to predict graduation admission chances, improving prediction accuracy by 35%. This experience ignited my curiosity and passion for the field, 
                setting <br> me on the path to pursue a career in data science and AI.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a project titled "Object Detection in Real-Time and Voice Output Using YOLO and PyTTSX3". This project, aimed at assisting visua-
                <br>lly impaired individuals, allowed me to apply YOLO and CNN techniques to detect objects in real-time and provide audio feedback. This project further cemented my interest in 
                <br>how technology can drive meaningful impact, especially in improving peopleâ€™s lives through innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                After graduation, I joined Nice Hi-tech Centre, a startup, as a Data Scientist, where I developed fraud detection models on Microsoft Azure. Leveraging Pyspark, SQL servers, and 
                <br>CI/CD pipelines, I improved infrastructure efficiency and reduced costs. My work achieved 81.29% accuracy in fraud detection while lowering hosting costs by 60%, showcasing 
                <br>my ability to develop scalable and efficient solutions in a startup environment.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                To deepen my expertise, I pursued a Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science at Clemson University. During my master's, I worked on diverse projects 
                <br>spanning industries like sales and marketing, healthcare, and business intelligence. These projects allowed me to stay updated on evolving technologies, such as cloud infra-
                <br>structure, data pipelines, data lakes, and advanced AI models, enabling me to apply my skills across various domains.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                One of my most impactful experiences was working with Clemson Engineers for Developing Communities (CEDC) as both a Data Analyst and Data Scientist intern. I led the devel-
                <br>-opment 
              of the Fund Navigator tool, collaborating with cross-functional teams and applying Scrum methodology and QA testing. By utilizing NLP techniques, Multinomial Naive 
              <br>Bayes, and 
                SMOTE, we improved grant allocation strategies by 45% and achieved 91.67% accuracy. Additionally, I led the analysis of disaster resilience interviews, identifying <br>key themes
                 like community engagement and disaster preparedness. Through efficient data storage and web scraping techniques using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium, we increased data 
                pipeline throughput by 35%. Managing a team of four, I trained members in Power BI, Tableau, and Python, improving project efficiency by 80%. This experience <br>honed my leader-
                ship and project management skills, balancing two complex projects alongside my coursework.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Currently, I work as an AI Data Scientist at the Human-AI Empowerment Lab at Clemson University, where I developed an AI-powered comment triage system using GEMMA-2B <br>and Gemini 
                 1.5 
                Pro models. This system improved feedback classification accuracy by 25% and reduced manual triage time by 50%, further solidifying my commitment to develo-
                <br>ping scalable, 
                AI-driven solutions. My focus is on exploring emerging technologies and contributing to impactful AI projects that push the boundaries of innovation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Throughout my journey, I have actively pursued opportunities to stay on the cutting edge of technology. From hands-on experience with cloud technologies like AWS, Microsoft 
                <br>  Azure,
                and Google Cloud, to deploying scalable data pipelines and leveraging data lakes for efficient processing, I have always been eager to learn and apply the latest advance-
                <br>ments.
               I have also completed several certifications from Google, Microsoft, and IBM through Coursera, including Google Advanced Data Analytics, Microsoft Power BI Analyst, and <br>IBM 
                Data Engineering.
