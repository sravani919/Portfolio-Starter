  <!-- Experience 1: University Admission Prediction System -->
  <article class="experience">
    <h3>Machine learning specialist (2019)</h3>
    <p><strong>Internship at Aptech | Duration: 3 months</strong></p>
    <p>
      Driven by a passion for applying data science to real-world challenges, I gained practical experience during an internship with Aptech, where I developed a machine learning model for a <strong>University Admission Prediction System</strong>. This project encompassed end-to-end data processing, model training, and evaluation. After testing multiple algorithms, I identified the <strong>Multi-layer Perceptron</strong> as the most effective model and deployed it on a website, enabling students to input their profiles and receive tailored college recommendations based on their likelihood of admission. This experience not only deepened my technical skills in machine learning and deployment but also showed me firsthand how AI can drive personalized, impactful solutions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved prediction accuracy by <strong>35%</strong> with model optimization.</li>
      <li>Utilized AWS EC2 for model deployment and AWS S3 for data storage.</li>
      <li>Integrated AWS Lambda to reduce processing time and costs, improving efficiency by <strong>20%</strong>.</li>
      <li>Streamlined API handling through integration with Amazon API Gateway, reducing shortlisting time by <strong>70%</strong>.</li>

<article class="experience">
  <h3> Machine learning and Python  (2020 - 2021)</h3>
  <p><strong>Final Year Project | Duration: 2020 - 2021</strong></p>
  <h4>Object Detection in Real-Time with Voice Output</h4>
  
  <p>
      In my final year, I developed a real-time object detection system using YOLO and pyttsx3 for voice output. This system assists visually impaired individuals by identifying and naming objects in their path, providing them with vital spatial awareness. It detects multiple objects in various environments and delivers audio messages to notify the user of any detected objects.
  </p>

  <ul>
      <li><strong>Adversarial Attacks</strong>: Explored techniques such as hiding attacks and misclassification attacks to test the robustness of the object detection system.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice Output</strong>: Integrated text-to-speech functionality using pyttsx3, enabling detected objects to be announced audibly.</li>
      <li><strong>YOLO Algorithm</strong>: Implemented the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, which offers high-speed processing with reliable accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Detection</strong>: Achieved a detection accuracy of over 95% with real-time processing, providing quick responses for user safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
      This project not only strengthened my technical knowledge but also inspired me deeply. The experience of creating a solution with real-world impact motivated me to pursue a master’s degree, with a vision to advance my career in data science and AI.

  <!-- Experience 2: Data Scientist at Nice Hi-Tech Centre -->
  <article class="experience">
    <h3>Data Scientist (2021-2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Nice Hi-Tech Centre | Duration: 1 year</strong></p>
    <p>
      After completing my bachelor’s degree, I initially planned to pursue a master’s program, but due to COVID-19, I decided to gain hands-on experience and joined <strong>Nice Hi-Tech Centre</strong> as a Data Scientist. In this dynamic startup environment, I tackled the <strong>Enron Fraud Detection Project</strong>, where I built robust data pipelines, performed feature engineering, and implemented machine learning models for fraud detection. Testing multiple algorithms, the <strong>AdaBoost model</strong> emerged as the most effective, achieving an accuracy of <strong>81.29%</strong> and showcasing my commitment to precision and reliability in threat detection.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deployed fraud detection models on Microsoft Azure using Pyspark and SQL for data management.</li>
      <li>Reduced inconsistencies by <strong>95%</strong> through effective feature engineering.</li>
      <li>Enhanced model performance by <strong>20%</strong> with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.</li>
      <li>Streamlined workflows with CI/CD pipelines, lowering hosting costs by <strong>60%</strong>.</li>
