<p>
    I am grateful to my manager, Victoriana Malvaso, who guided me through the grant automation project with great expertise, and to Rieta Drinkwine, who supported me in my Data Analyst role with her remarkable leadership and understanding. Recognizing my capabilities, Rieta promoted me to Team Leader, where I managed a diverse team of four individuals who were new to data analysis tools. I provided them with guidance on tool functionality, outlined code structures, and developed templates to streamline the analysis process. I created templates and reusable code structures so they could easily change file names and perform analysis across multiple files. To ensure everyone’s understanding, I occasionally held one-on-one sessions, giving them hands-on support and detailed explanations.

      <h2 class="section-title">Personal Passions</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I am passionate about dance. I constantly strive to learn new dance styles, and I've performed in various events during school and college. Another special part of my life is my pet, <strong>Leo</strong>, who remains one of my favorite companions. Above all, my parents are my pillars. My father, despite his physical challenges, has always been my strongest supporter, inspiring me to pursue my dreams without limitations.
