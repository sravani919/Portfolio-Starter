              I am a professional specializing in transforming complex data into actionable insights, leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning to drive data-driven decisions and solutions. With a strong academic background and extensive internship experiences, I have developed deep expertise in data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization tools like Python, Tableau, and Power BI. My journey in data science began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Visvesvaraya Technological University, followed by a Master's degree in Computer Science from Clemson University, where I honed my skills in networks, systems, and security, maintaining a GPA of 3.8/4.0.

<br>
<br>With nearly two years of professional experience as an intern, I have worked in data-driven roles at organizations such as Clemson Engineers for Developing Communities, Nice Hi-Tech Centre, and Aptech. At Clemson Engineers for Developing Communities, I worked as both a Data Analyst Intern and Data Science Intern, leading projects that combined data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and geographic analysis to extract insights from data. Key projects included the Disaster Management and Community Resilience Analysis and the DSR3P Fund Navigator, where I developed machine learning models for grant categorization. At Nice Hi-Tech Centre, I contributed to the Enron Fraud Detection project, improving the organization's security through predictive modeling.

My project experience spans various domains, including healthcare, marketing, sales, security, and database management. Notable projects include Executive Sales Analysis, Object Detection using Python YOLO, TikTok Classification, Migraine Classification, Graduate Prediction, and Failure Point Automation. These projects utilized tools and technologies such as Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Tableau, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and SQL databases.
<br>
<br>
I hold certifications in Google Advanced Data Analytics and Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst, underscoring my commitment to staying at the forefront of technology and data science. Check my full portfolio to discover my projects, experience, skills, and more in detail.
