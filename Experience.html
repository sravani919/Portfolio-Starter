                  <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
                  <p>During my tenure as a Data Scientist at Clemson Engineers for Developing Communities, I worked on the DSR3P Fund Navigator project. This project involved developing and implementing advanced machine learning models to automate the categorization of federal grants, significantly improving the grant application process for low-capacity communities and successfully classifying over 70 grants for future automation.</p>

                      <h3>Overview of DSR3P Fund Navigator Project</h3>
                      <p>Federal grants aim to provide financial assistance for public services and to support the economy. However, the grant application process can be difficult due to eligibility requirements, fund-matching requirements, and specific technical needs for the application1. Though many of these grants are targeted towards the most vulnerable communities, higher-capacity communities often out-compete low-capacity communities for the grants due to more competitive applications. These higher-capacity communities often have dedicated staff for grant applying and technical support. The grant application process can take a significant amount of time and effort, leading low-capacity communities who are already over-taxed to not apply or to not meet all requirements. This, in turn, widens the resource gap between communities. The DSR3P team aims to reduce this resource gap by developing a tool that helps match community needs with grants that they may be eligible for. </p>
