            <h3>Executive Sales Analysis</h3>
            <p>This project involved preparing and configuring data for analysis, designing and developing a data model, configuring aggregations using DAX, creating sales and profit reports, and finally creating an executive dashboard with alerts and subscriptions.</p>

            <h2>Milestone 1: Data Preparation and Model Development</h2>
            <h3> Prepare the Sales Excel Data</h3>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the file and open the Sales worksheet from the Excel workbook.</p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-07-07 171313.png" alt="Code Screenshot" class="code-image">
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Calculate Gross Revenue by inserting a new column and using the formula =E2*G2.</p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-07-07 173317.png" alt="Code Screenshot" class="code-image">
            <p> Select the first cell under the Gross Revenue column. Enter the formula =E2*G2 and press Enter to apply the formula to this first cell.</p>

            <img src="Screenshot 2024-07-07 173727.png" alt="Code Screenshot" class="code-image">
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate Total Tax using the formula =F2*G2.</p>
            <p>Create a Total Tax column next to Gross Revenue.
                Insert a new column to the right of Gross Revenue and label it Total Tax.
                </p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-07-07 173901.png" alt="Code Screenshot" class="code-image">

            <h2>Milestone 2: Configure Aggregations and Create Reports</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Overview </h3>
               <p> In the second set of Capstone project exercises, we had to assist Tailwind Traders with configuring its aggregations and generating insights in the form of reports from its data.</p>
               <p> The two exercises  in this second phase were:</p>
               <p> •	Configure aggregations using DAX.</p>
               <p> •	And create sales and profit reports.</p>
               <p> This reading provides  a step-by-step guide for completing these tasks. It also includes screenshots that you can compare against your work.</p>
               
            <h3> Configure Aggregations using DAX</h3>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Calculate Yearly Profit Margin using DAX.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Create a new measure for the Sales in USD table.
                Right-click on the Sales in USD table in the Fields pane and select New Column
                </p>

                <img src="Screenshot 2024-07-08 193202.png" alt="Code Screenshot" class="code-image">
                <p>In the formula bar, create a new column that represents the yearly profit margin. This margin should be derived by dividing the gross revenue by the total net revenue within the Sales in USD table.</p>
                <p>Right-click on the Sales in USD table in the Fields pane and select New Column to set the stage for this calculation. Then, input the provided DAX formula into the formula bar.</p>
                    
                <p> Yearly Profit Margin = 'Sales in USD'[Gross Revenue USD] / 'Sales in USD'[Net Revenue USD]</p>
                <p>This calculation divides the Gross Revenue by the Net Revenue, and shows how much money is kept as profit from sales after costs. This measure provides an overarching view of Tailwind Traders’ financial efficiency throughout the year and is a key indicator of the company's financial health.</p>
                    </p>
                    <img src="Screenshot 2024-07-08 193357.png" alt="Code Screenshot" class="code-image">
                
                    

            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Calculate Quarterly Profit using DAX and time intelligence functions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Create a new measure for quarterly profit. Consider using a function that aggregates data until the end of the current quarter. To achieve this, you must reference the calculated yearly profit and a calendar table.</p>
            <p> As you did in the previous task, right-click the Sales in USD table in the Fields pane and select New Column. Then, input the provided DAX formula into the formula bar:</p>
                
            <p> Quarterly Profit = CALCULATE([Yearly Profit Margin], DATESQTD('CalendarTable'[Date]))</p>
            <p>This calculation isolates the profit made in each quarter by using a time intelligence function, which filters the profit to each respective quarter. This data provides actionable insights for short-term planning and strategy.</p>
                </p>
                <img src="Screenshot 2024-07-08 193605.png" alt="Code Screenshot" class="code-image">

                

            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate Year-to-Date Profit using DAX.</p>
            <br>
            <p>1.	Right-click on the Sales in USD table in the Fields pane and select New Measure.</p>
            <p>2.	Create a new measure for the year-to-date profit. You'll need a function aggregating data from the start of the year to the current date.</p>
            <p> As you did in the previous task, right-click the Sales in USD table in the Fields pane and select New Column. Then, input the provided DAX formula into the formula bar:</p>
                
            <p>  YTD Profit = TOTALYTD([Yearly Profit Margin], 'CalendarTable'[Date])</p>
            <p> This measure accumulates the profit from the first day of the fiscal year to the current date, providing a running total of Tailwind Traders' profitability. This step provides a real-time snapshot of the company’s financial trajectory, allowing for comparison against the same period in previous years or projected targets.

                <br>



            <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Calculate Median Sales using the MEDIAN function in DAX.</p>
            <br>
            <p>1.	Right-click on the Sales in USD table in the Fields pane and choose New Measure.</p>
            <p> 2.	In the formula bar, create a new measure to represent the median sales. Consider the statistical functions in DAX that can help you find the middle value of gross revenue.</p>
            <p>  Right-click on the Sales in USD table and choose New Measure. Input the provided DAX formula into the formula bar.</p>
                
            <p>  Median Sales = MEDIAN('Sales in USD'[Gross Revenue USD])</p>
            <p>The median is a statistical measure that indicates the middle value in a set of numbers, which, in this case, represents sales volumes. Using the MEDIAN function on Gross Revenue identifies the sales value at the center of the dataset.

                <br>

            <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use the Performance Analyzer to optimize report performance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>1.	Find and select the Performance Analyzer option within the View tab.</p>
            <p>   Upon selecting the Report view icon, you must open the Performance Analyzer. Locate and select the View tab on the ribbon interface at the top of your Power BI report. Within the View tab, find and select the Performance Analyzer option.
