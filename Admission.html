        <h2>Graduate Admission Prediction Using Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>This project involves predicting the chance of admission to graduate programs using machine learning models. Leveraging features such as CGPA, GRE Score, and TOEFL Score, the analysis identified vital influencers and determined that a Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 95%. Further, a threshold adjustment analysis fine-tuned predictions, showcasing the model's adaptability to specific requirements.</p> 
        <h3>Objective</h3>

        <p>Building upon previous work where three distinct machine learning models were employed to predict the chance of admission for graduate students in software-related master's programs, the current objective is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation to determine the accuracy of each model. The aim is to identify and designate a champion model with superior performance in predicting admission probabilities. This project phase emphasizes refining and selecting the most effective predictive model for better decision-making in the graduate admission process.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Data Exploration</h3>
        <p>Dataset The dataset comprises 400 samples, each representing a student applying for graduate studies.
            <br>
            - Features include GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP (Statement of Purpose) rating, LOR (Letter of Recommendation) rating, CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average), Research experience, and the target variable, 'Chance of Admit.'
            </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
        <h4>1. Handling Serial No</h4>
        <p>
            - Identified 'Serial No.' as an index column for students.
            <br>
            - Removed the 'Serial No.' column as it served as an index and did not contribute to the analysis.
         </p>
        
         <br>
        <h4>
            2. Handling Column Labels:</h4>
        <p> - Identified and corrected columns with added spaces in the labels.
            <br>
            - Renamed columns 'Chance of Admit ' to 'Chance of Admit' and 'LOR ' to 'LOR.'</p>
         
        
        <br>
        <h4>
            3. Cleaning Blank Spaces:</h4>
        <p>    - I ensured the removal of any additional blank spaces from the dataset.
            <br>
            - This step was performed to enhance consistency and avoid potential issues related to column names.</p>
         
        <br>
        <h4>
            4. Checking for Null Values:</h4>
        <p>      - Checked for null values in the dataset using `df. isnull().sum()`.
            <br>
            - Confirmed that there were no null values in the dataset after preprocessing.
         </p>
        <br>
        <p>The preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the dataset's cleanliness, removing unnecessary information, and setting the foundation for subsequent exploratory analysis and machine learning modeling. The dataset is now well-organized, and any potential issues related to column names and missing values have been addressed.

        </p>

        <br>
        3. Performance Metrics: Precision, recall, and accuracy at each threshold.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>- Threshold: 0.00 - Precision: 0.88, Recall: 1.00, Accuracy: 0.88
            <br>
            - Threshold: 0.50 (Default) - Precision: 0.95, Recall: 1.00, Accuracy: 0.95
            <br>
            - Threshold: 0.95 - Precision: 0.98, Recall: 0.77, Accuracy: 0.79</p>
        <br>
        <p>Insights: Default threshold (0.50) provides a balanced trade-off. Adjust threshold based on specific use case requirements.
            <br>

            Recommendation: The default threshold (0.50) seems suitable for a balanced precision-recall trade-off.</p>
